Package URL specification v1.0.X
================================

The Package URL core specification defines a versioned and formalized format,
syntax, and rules used to represent and validate `purl`.

A `purl` or package URL is an attempt to standardize existing approaches to
reliably identify and locate software packages.

A `purl` is a URL string used to identify and locate a software package in a
mostly universal and uniform way across programming languages, package managers,
packaging conventions, tools, APIs and databases.

Such a package URL is useful to reliably reference the same software package
using a simple and expressive syntax and conventions based on familiar URLs.
